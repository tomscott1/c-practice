### PEAK FINDING ###
- [ ] 1D peak finding
    - [x] Linear Search
    > Position n iff n >= n-1 and n >= n+1, then peak

    - [x] Binary Search
    > Look at n/2 Position  
    > if array[n/2] < array[n/2-1] then look left half  
    > left half 1... n/2 -1 to look for a peak  
    > else if array[n/2] < array[m/2+1] then look right  
    > else peak found at n/2
